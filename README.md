# AGTproject
Final project in AGT course at the Technion, based on “Planning Problems for Sophisticated Agents with Present Bias”.

In this report written on the basis of the paper mentioned above, our main goal was to receive practical results that would both validate the claims made in the paper, and that would provide a basis for further research on the field of partially naive agents.
By running an elaborate simulation, we tried to mimic the behavior of each agent in a practical environment, and searched for behavioral patterns for each type of agent, while also looking at the relation between the bias ratio and performance of each optimistic and pessimistic partially naive agent.
